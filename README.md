# React

This project acts as a template for front-end application's using Facebook's React and Flux libraries, along with several other tools and technologies.

It embodies a rather extensive amount of research into this style of architecture and attempts to create an opinionated structure for building on.  Additionally, our hope is that this can act as a kicking off point for beginners of React or as a solid base to those who already have some experience.
